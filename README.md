## About
This little game is a mimic of the classic arcade game, Frogger. Use the arrow keys to navigate the player to the water without touching any of those disgusting cockroaches. If you hit one - you have to start all over again!

## Getting Started
Open this game at https://rachelpfeiffer.github.io/frogger/ to play!
Or feel free to open the JS files to enjoy the scintillating code.

## Credits
Code is based off of Udacity's starter files for the game. 
Thank you Mike Koenig for the Tada and Boing sound effects!
